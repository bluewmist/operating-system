## Learning Operating System from Scratch

Welcome to this project! I'm diving deep into operating systems with a focus on understanding core concepts through hands-on learning. My goal is to strengthen my foundation in operating systems by implementing the concepts whenever possible.

The below mentioned resources are followed to give us a direction but the learning and implementation will not be limited to the books.
- [three easy pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- [csapp](https://github.com/wangmu0115/Book-CSAPP/blob/master/_Attachments/Computer_Systems_A_Programmers_Perspective(3rd).pdf)

The main goal is to try implementing the concepts when possible. I will be working on the homework section of the book Three-Easy-Pieces for practice. I will be extensively using the Search Engine and LLMs to improve my understanding on a particular concept if necessary.

I will be taking brief notes in markdown format on Obsidian which will be uploaded to this repository. Beyond the books, I'll implement extra projects that reinforce key operating system concepts, aiming to provide a well-rounded understanding.

Contributions are always welcome. If you're also passionate about learning fundamental CS concepts, feel free to enhance this repository. Together, we can build a resource that supports learning OS and CS fundamentals before moving into more abstract technologies, encouraging creativity in problem-solving.

I am new to both writing long-form content and maintaining a big project so pardon my errors and I would like your critical feedback to help me grow.
